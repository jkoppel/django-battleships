      "description": "Welcome to the code tour of the `django-battleships` project! In this tour, we will focus on understanding how the turn logic is implemented in this codebase. Turn logic is crucial in a turn-based game like Battleships because it ensures that players take turns in a fair and orderly manner, which is essential for maintaining game balance and player engagement.\n\nWe'll explore the key data structures and control flows that govern the turn logic, ensuring you get a comprehensive understanding of how turns are managed in the game. Specifically, we'll look at how the game state is tracked, how the system determines whose turn it is, and how turns are processed and validated.\n\nBy the end of this tour, you should have a clear understanding of how turn logic is implemented in this codebase, which will help you appreciate the underlying mechanics that make the game function smoothly. Let's dive in!",

      "description": "Let's start by looking at the `Game` model in `games/models.py`. This model tracks the overall game state and turn order. The `turn` field is an integer that keeps track of the current turn number. Each time a player takes a turn, this number is incremented.\n\nIn Django, models are used to define the structure of your database tables. The `Game` model is linked to the `Team` model through a reverse relationship, which we'll see in the `Team` model next. This relationship allows each game to have multiple teams, and each team to know which game it belongs to.\n\nUnderstanding this interaction is crucial because the turn logic relies on knowing which team's turn it is, and this is determined by the `turn` field in the `Game` model and the `last_turn` field in the `Team` model. We'll explore this interaction further in the next step.",

Notice how it interacts with the `Game` model through the `game` ForeignKey, which establishes a relationship between each team and the game they are part of. The `last_turn` field in the `Team` model is particularly important as it records the last turn number when the team made a move. This helps in determining the turn order and ensuring the correct team is allowed to play next. Understanding this relationship is key to grasping how the turn logic is managed in the game.",

This function determines if it is a specific team's turn by comparing the last turn timestamps of all alive teams. This is crucial for maintaining the turn-based flow of the game, ensuring that each team gets their fair turn in the correct order.\n\nIn the context of the game, this function helps manage the user experience by enforcing the rules of turn-taking. Without this, players might be able to take multiple turns in a row, disrupting the fairness and flow of the game.\n\nLet's break down the code:\n- `alive_teams = game.teams.filter(alive=True)`: This line filters out the teams that are still in the game (i.e., not defeated).\n- `return (team == min(alive_teams, key=lambda team: team.last_turn))`: This line checks if the given team has the earliest `last_turn` value among all alive teams, indicating it's their turn next.\n\nUnderstanding this function is key to grasping how the game enforces turn order and ensures a smooth, fair gameplay experience.",

It uses the `from_game` class method to create an instance of `GamePresenter` from a `Game` object. This method iterates over all teams in the game and uses the `TeamPresenter` to format each team.\n\nThe `TeamPresenter` class does something similar for `Team` objects. It includes a `make_tiles` method to prepare the game board tiles for display. The `from_team` class method creates an instance of `TeamPresenter` from a `Team` object, including details like whether it's the team's turn, if they are the winner, and if they are still alive.\n\nThis approach ensures that the data is well-structured and ready for rendering in the views, which is essential for a good user experience.

      "description": "We have now covered the key components involved in the turn logic of the `django-battleships` project. Let's summarize how these components work together to manage the turn-based gameplay:\n\n1. **Game and Team Models**: The `Game` model tracks the overall state of the game, including the current turn number. The `Team` model links players to specific games and tracks their status and turn history. Think of these models as the backbone of the game, holding essential data that drives the gameplay.\n\n2. **is_team_next Function**: This utility function checks if it is a specific team's turn by comparing the last turn timestamps of all alive teams. It ensures that turns are taken in the correct order, much like a referee in a game ensuring fair play.\n\n3. **GameView Class**: This view handles the display of the game board and ensures the player is authenticated and authorized. It sets up the context for the game, including whether it is the player's turn, similar to how a UX designer sets up the user interface to provide the necessary information and actions to the user.\n\n4. **AttackView Class**: This view processes player attacks, verifies turn order, validates attack coordinates, records shots, updates the game state, and checks for hits, ship destruction, and game completion. It acts like the game engine, processing player actions and updating the game state accordingly.\n\n5. **GamePresenter and TeamPresenter Classes**: These classes prepare the game and team data for presentation in the views. They transform the raw data into a format that is easy to display and understand, much like how a UX designer would prepare data for a user-friendly interface.\n\nTogether, these components manage the turn-based gameplay, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience for the players. The models hold the game data, the utility function ensures the correct turn order, the views handle player interactions and game state updates, and the presenters prepare the data for display. I hope this tour has provided you with a clear understanding of how turn logic is implemented in this codebase. Happy coding!",
